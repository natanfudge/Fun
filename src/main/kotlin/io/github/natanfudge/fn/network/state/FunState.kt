// IDEA: things to think about:
// 0. Had an amazing epiphany - the cases where you want to send messages to the server are extremely limited - specifically -
// just input! We set up these events on the engine side:
// fun onKeypress(key: Key) {
// ...
// }
// fun onClick(pos / orientation) {
// ....
// }
// We let the user implement those and we just run it on both the client and the server. Server-made state changes are synced.
//0 . Change the tests to be client + server with server making the changes for them to make sense
// 1. The main issue I'm having is i'm not sure who should initiate state changes. I originally thought that the client will tell the server
// to perform an action and then simulate that action, but it might make sense to have the server initiate things. I guess it depends on input events vs game events.
// I need an example of a game so better model the API.
// 2. 'secret' values - values only visible to their owner.
// 2b. Make sure we don't have 'the diablo 4 case' where you are forced to sync everything. You should be allowed to opt in and receive values on demand.
// 3. Protection of values - modifying values only from the server. Modification should only be allowed within a "server-prediction" context.
// There should never be an option to "just set a value" with no checks. For this reason, we will throw an error on the client for the developers.
// Circumventing this won't be possible because there will be no "just set this value" endpoint. Make sure to emphasize not to create such a thing to developers.
// 4. Prediction - running server logic on the client for as long as possible
// 4b. Prediction + server correction/rubberbanding. How do we allow prediction while avoiding incorrect values? How do we make rubberbanding a good experience for the user? (some manual input needed here)
// 4b2 Prediction - sometimes disagreemenet between prediction and server will cause serious issues, like when two players try to press a button first.
// 4c. prediction + server messages - how do we avoid server messages causing redundant or incorrectly ordered state changes - such as when a
// list add is predicted and the server also applies the add, resulting in 2 adds instead of the intended single add?
// 4d. prediction
// 5. Merged client-server optimization - how can we reuse objects in case the client and server are running in the same process?
// 6. See how we can optimize object IDs in production to avoid a separate ID for each instance
// 7. Some sort of API Fun.child(id: String) that creates a child state of a Fun.
// 8. We could have a SinglePlayerFun that doesn't require specifying a client.
// 9. Compiler plugin: see compiler plugin.md
// 10. Think about how we are gonna pass Fun components through RPC methods
// 11. Creating a post in reddit is a good example of why we need FunNetworking prediction. When you create a post, you need to wait loads of time. BUt tbh the way the data is stored in reddit is not done in memory so it's not really the same. But perhaps we can support such use cases.
// 12. Opt out of multiplayer features by default and avoid sending messages all the time
// 13. Think about if multiplayer is enabled, should making a single property be synced opt in or opt out? or perhaps it should be on a Fun component level? I think best is configurable.
// until the server is created on the server and only then you get a response
// 14. A lot of times state is stored outside of memory, so we should set up some way to route changes in state externally,
// e.g. adding to a list would modify a mongo database.
// This is not really needed for games though so idk if i'm gonna do this.
// It's probably a good idea for general support because being able to do this is like 90% of app cases
// But tbh it's a whole bag of worms because you might need to do caching and such (automatic redis anyone)? Or tbh devs could route it to redis and it would be fine.
// 15. Compose MutableState integration
// 16. Send state changes in batches. Configurable amount of delay to organize batches. Default - a few ms, configurable to maybe even 0.1ms.
// 17. simulated latency, enabled by default
// 18. Make sure messages arrive at the order they were sent (see multithreading doc in FunState)

/**
 * Base interface for all synchronized state objects in the Fun network system.
 *
 * FunState objects represent data that is automatically synchronized across all clients
 * in a multiplayer environment. When a FunState object is modified on one client,
 * the changes are automatically propagated to all other clients.
 *
 * Implementations include:
 * - [ClientFunValue] - For single values
 * - [FunList] - For synchronized lists
 * - [FunMap] - For synchronized maps
 * - [FunSet] - For synchronized sets
 *
 * *******
 * **Multithreading and FunState**
 *
 * There's four potential points of multithreading danger when using [FunState]s.
 * 1. *One thread modifies a value locally, another modifies it at the same time, boom*.
 *
 *    Here, the challenge is identical to when dealing with normal variables. Multithreaded access
 *    to mutable variables should be guarded with synchronization.
 *
 * 2. *Two state modifications are received externally from the same authority,
 * but with an incorrect order, producing the wrong final state*
 *
 *      This case is solved by Fun itself, by making sure messages arrive at the order they were sent.
 *      As long as the sender observes correct state, the receiver will also observe correct state.
 * 3. *Two different authorities decide on incompatible state changes at the same time*.
 *
 *      It is possible to synchronize such cases on the server
 *      In general, usages for directly setting a value 'on the client's whim', and outside a server+client-prediction scope, is limited,
 *      therefore we require all changes to state be made inside such a context.
 *
 * 4. *A prediction interferes with the message received from the server*
 *
 *     This is a difficult case and is handled extensively by the prediction implementation.
