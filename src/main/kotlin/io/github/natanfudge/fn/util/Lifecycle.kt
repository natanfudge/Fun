 * be started or stopped. When this happens, the child lifecycle will have the parent's data available for use.
 *
 * [Lifecycle]s may have multiple parents, in which case they will be started and stopped when either one of them are,
 * as long as all the parents have been started already. In this case, the child will receive the data that ALL of its parents have created.
 *
 * Finally, any part of a [Lifecycle] hierarchy may be restarted arbitrarily - in which case the existing data will be reused, except for
 * new data that has been created as a result of this restart.
 *
 * This class is extremely thread-unsafe. A lifecycle hierarchy should be touched within the same thread.
 * [P] is the type of the parent(s) of this lifecycle, and [T] is the type of the root of this lifecycle.
 * Note that we don't do `Lifecycle<P,T> = MutableTree<P,T>` because that would signify everything is `<P,T>` all the way down, which is not true.
